									<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
						
								</div>
								
								<p>The Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management was signed by the

Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Chiefs of 14 First Nations

on February 12, 1996.

Canada agreed to ratify the Framework Agreement by enacting federal legislation

consistent with the Framework Agreement.

The First Nations Land Management Act, was given Royal Assent on June 17, 1999.

The Agreement is an initiative of these 14 First Nations to take over the management

and control of their lands and resources.

It applied only to these 14 First Nations.

The Chiefs and the Minister have since agreed to allow other First Nations who want to

be included to sign an adhesion to the Agreement.

The Framework Agreement sets out the principal components of this new land

management regime, but it is not a Treaty and does not affect Treaty or other

constitutional rights of the First Nations.

The Framework Agreement provides First Nations with the option to manage their

reserve lands outside the Indian Act.

The option to regain control of lands and resources can only be taken with the consent

of the community.

Only when a First Nation takes control of it’s lands and resources under the Agreement,

will federal administration of it’s reserve lands stop under the Indian Act.</p>

                       
                       <h3>TAKING CONTROL OF LAND MANAGEMENT</h3>
                       <p>A First Nation signatory to the Framework Agreement exercises its land management

option by creating its own Land Code, drafting a community ratification process and

entering into an Individual Transfer Agreement with Canada.

The specific steps are set out in the Framework Agreement and include the following:</p>

<h3>The Land Code</h3>
<p>A Land Code, drafted by the community, will be the basic land law of the First Nation

and will replace the land management provisions of the Indian Act.

The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will no longer be involved in

the management of First Nation’s reserve lands.

The Land Code does not have to be approved by the Minister.

The Land Code is drafted by each First Nation and provides for the following

matters:

Identifies the reserve lands to be managed by the First Nation (called “First Nation

land”)

Sets out the general rules and procedures for the use and occupation of these lands by

First Nation members and others,



Provides financial accountability for revenues from the lands (except oil and gas

revenues, which continue under federal law),

Provides the procedures for making and publishing First Nation laws,

Provides conflict of interest rules,

Provides a community process to develop rules and procedures applicable to land on

the breakdown of marriage,

Identifies a dispute resolution process,

Sets out procedures by which the First Nation can grant interests in land or acquire

lands for community purposes,

Allows the delegation of land management responsibilities; and

Sets out the procedure for amending the Land Code</p>

<h3>Individual Transfer Agreement</h3>
<p>An Individual Transfer Agreement between each community and the minister will

be negotiated to deal with such matters as:

The reserve lands to be managed by the First Nation,

The specifics of the transfer of the administration of land from Canada to the First

Nation,

The operational funding to be provided by Canada to the First Nation for land

management.</p>
			
            
            <h3>Community Ratification Process</h3>
<p>In order for the First Nation to assume control over its lands, the Land Code and the

Individual Transfer Agreement must be ratified by the adult members of the First Nation.

All members of the First Nation who are at least 18 years of age, whether living off-

reserve or on-reserve, have the right to vote on the Land Code and the Individual

Transfer Agreement.

The procedure for the community ratification process is developed by the community in

accordance with the Framework Agreement.

Most FNs have their eligible voters register to vote

Minimum threshold of 25% +1 of all eligible voters must participate and vote in favor</p>
            


            <h3>Verification</h3>
            <p>An independent person select jointly by the First Nation and Canada, called a Verifier,

will confirm that the community ratification process and Land Code are consistent with

the Framework Agreement.

The Verifier will monitor the community ratification process to ensure that the rules the

community made are followed.</p>

            <h3>Transfer of Land Management</h3>
            <p>If the community ratifies the Land Code and Individual Transfer Agreement, control over

First Nation land and resources is transferred from under the Indian Act to the First

Nation’s land laws and administration.</p>

            <h3>Title To First Nation Lands</h3>
            <p>Reserve lands under the Indian Act are held by Her Majesty and are set apart for the

use and benefit of a First Nation. This will not change under the Framework Agreement.

These lands remain a federal responsibility under section 91(24) of the Constitution Act,

1867.

In addition, the First Nation’s lands will be protected against surrender for sale.</p>

            <h3>Legal Status and Powers</h3>
            <p>The Framework Agreement provides these First Nations with all the legal status and

powers needed to manage and govern their lands and resources.

While First Nations will not be able to sell their land, they will be able to lease or

develop their lands and resources, subject to any limits imposed by their own

community in laws and Land Codes.</p>

<h4></h4>
<p></p>

            <h3>Law-Making Powers</h3>
            <p>A First Nation managing its lands under a Land Code will have the power to make laws

in respect of the development, conservation, protection, management, use and

possession of First Nation land. The Land Code does not authorize laws relating to the

taxation of real or personal property. (or oil and gas)

Such laws must be made separately pursuant to section 83 of the Indian Act. The First

Nation’s Council can continue to make by-laws under section 81 of the Indian Act.

[Taxation by-law]</p>

            <h3>Land Management</h3>
            <p>The Framework Agreement provides the First Nation with all the powers of an owner in

relation to its First Nation land, except for control over title or the power to sell it.

The First Nation’s Council can manage land and resources, as well as revenues from

the land and resources, in accordance with it’s Land Code.</p>

            <h3>Third Party Interests</h3>
            <p>Interests in First Nation land held by third parties, or by Canada, will continue in effect

according to their terms and conditions under a Land Code.

No new interests or licences may be acquired or granted except in accordance with the

Land Code.</p>

            <h3>First Nation Expropriation</h3>
            <p>The First Nation will have the power to acquire lands for community purposes upon

payment of fair compensation to those whose interests are affected.</p>

            <h3>Accountability</h3>
            <p>A Land Code will make provision for a First Nation to report to its members and to be

accountable for its management of lands, resources and revenues.</p>

            <h3>Marriage Breakdown</h3>
            <p>A First Nation will finally be able to deal with the rights of spouses to interests in First

Nation land if their marriage breaks down. This is not currently addressed under the

Indian Act.

The community will, within 12 months, develop and enact rules and procedures on this

topic.

The new rules and procedures will ensure the equality of men and women.</p>

            <h3>Registration of Interests</h3>
            <p>Canada will maintain a First Nations Land Register to record all documents respecting

interests in the reserve lands by the First Nations who have enacted a Land Code.

Each First Nation may maintain a duplicate land register within their own community.</p>

                            <div id="snav-content00">
								<div class="title-block">
									<h3>PROTECTION OF FIRST NATION LAND</h3>
						
								</div>
                                <p>Preserving the quantity and quality of existing First Nations lands is a fundamental

principle of the Framework Agreement.

Some aspects of this principle are summarized as follows.</p>
								
								 <h3>Taxation and Seizure under Legal Process</h3>
            <p>The current exemption of reserve lands, and personal property situated on-reserve, will

continue under the relevant provisions of the Indian Act.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Protection</h3>
            <p>A First Nation will have the power to make environmental laws.

Further agreements are expected between First Nations and Canada for funding these

laws and for harmonization with other provincial and federal environmental laws.</p>

             <h3>Voluntary Exchange of Lands</h3>
            <p>A First Nation may decide that it is advantageous to exchange some of its First Nation

land for other lands.

Provisions can be made in its Land Code for a procedure to negotiate and approve

such exchanges.

An exchange of land cannot occur without the consent of the First Nation community.</p>

             <h3>No Provincial Expropriation</h3>
            <p>Under the Framework Agreement there can be no expropriation of First Nation land by

a provincial or municipal government or agency.</p>

             <h3>Restricted Federal Expropriation</h3>
            <p>Canada’s power to expropriate First Nation land is restricted.

That power can only be exercised with Cabinet approval and only when the

expropriation is justified and necessary for a federal public purpose that serves the

national interest.

Compensation must include provision for equivalent lands so that the land base for the

First Nation is not diminished.</p>

             <h3>Enforcement</h3>
            <p>The First Nation will have full power to enforce its land and environmental laws and may

enter into further agreements with other jurisdictions to assist in such enforcement.

A First Nation can appoint its own Justice of the Peace to try offences created under a

Land Code or a First Nation law, and can appoint its own prosecutor.

First Nation laws may make provision for search and seizure, fines imprisonment,

restitution, community service or alternate means for achieving compliance with its laws.</p>

            <h3>CONTINUING FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
            <p>Canada will remain liable for and will indemnify a First Nation for losses suffered as a

result of any act or omission by Canada, or its agents, that occurred before the Land

Code comes into effect.

After that date, the First Nation is responsible for its own acts or omissions in managing

its lands.</p>

            <h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
            <p>The First Nation will establish its own procedures for dealing with disputes in relation to

its lands and resources. These can include mediation, neutral evaluation and arbitration.

In the case of a disagreement between the First Nations and Canada on the meaning or

implementation of the Framework Agreement, there are provisions in the Framework

Agreement to resolve the dispute outside the courts.</p>

            <h3>LANDS ADVISORY BOARD</h3>
            <p>The First Nations established a Lands Advisory Board to assist them in implementing

their own land management regimes. The LAB have also incorporated a Resource

Centre to assist operational and developmental First Nations by developing model land

codes, laws, documents, agreements and management systems and providing

technical information when requested.</p>

            <h3>Benefits From Community Developed Land Code</h3>
            <ul class="content-listing"><li> First real recognition of our right inherent to manage our own reserve lands and

resources;</li>

<li> Removal of our reserve lands from the management provisions of the Indian Act;</li>

<li> Community control over our Land Management and Development;</li>

<li> More efficient management of our reserve land;</li>

<li> Protection against arbitrary expropriation of our land;</li>

<li> Recognition of real law-making powers respecting First Nations;</li>

<li> Ability to create local dispute resolution processes;
</li>
<li> Ability to reflect First Nations own traditions in the Land Code</li></ul>

            <h3>Possible Negatives</h3>
            <p>Not for every First Nation

Huge amount of responsibility

No one there to bail you out if you make a mistake

Should carry liability insurance</p>
